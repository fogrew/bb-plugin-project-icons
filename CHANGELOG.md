## Unreleased

### Added

- Contributor and agent workflow documentation covering Git Flow, signed
  commits, review gates, version policy and session handoffs
  ([#1](https://github.com/fogrew/bb-plugin-project-icons/issues/1)).

### Changed

- Clarified English-language publishing across projects, with scoped explicit
  user exceptions and support for Unicode, emoji and necessary test fixtures.
- Separated parallel development readiness from integration/release readiness;
  documented stacked dependency PRs and revalidation while preserving signed
  working history.
- Aligned ordinary autonomous PR merge gates with the global workflow, including
  risk-based independent review and mandatory GPG signatures on merge output;
  signing incompatibilities block merging. Releases and repo settings remain
  owner responsibilities.
